This folder contains the results of 20 sequences of the docking benchmark. 
See the data in the "data" folder in the following path:
    /home/stolosa/Documents/BSC_internship/ESM2/esmfold/pp_docking/data/limited_files_650_20seq.fasta

This data contains the complex sequences separated using a slash ("/"). The problem is that the results were orientated in a wrong way comparing to the original PDB structure. So, I tried to separate them as the model GitHub say, by using ":" (in a first try this does not work for me aparently) and it works correctly.
