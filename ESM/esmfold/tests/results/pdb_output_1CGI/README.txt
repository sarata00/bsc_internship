Here you can find two pdb from the same complex (1CGI).

Both seems to be similar,  but the input in each case was different. In both cases, the sequence of each
monomer of the complex has been merge in a single sequence, separated by:

- 1CGI_complex_2.pdb: just a dot --> monomer1.monomer2
- 1CGI_E_I_Complex.pdb: using a slash --> monomer1/monomer2

So both metodologies work?

The thing is the orientation of the complex is not correct
