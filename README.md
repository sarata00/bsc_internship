This repository will contain all the data, scripts and results obtained from my internship in the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) tutorized by Miguel Romero in the Computational Biology Group (Life Science department).

Currently, the distribution of the folders is the following:

*  [`ESM`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm)
    * `esmfold`: this folder contains all the data generated by using the [ESMFold model](). Each folder normally contains in turn two folders: data and results, with the input and output files, respectively.
        * tests: some examples to test the model
        * pp_docking: data related to the [Protein-Protein docking benchmark](https://zlab.umassmed.edu/benchmark/)
        * colaboracion: data related to the colaboration with UCM
        * scripts: Python scripts used to run the model
    

* `OpenFold`: this folder contains all the data, scripts and results related to the [OpenFold model](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold).


More information will be available soon...
